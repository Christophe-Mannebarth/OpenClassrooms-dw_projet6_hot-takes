## Frontend & Backend - Mannebarth Christophe \_ 09/2022

## Prerequisites:

You will need to have Node (https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed locally on your machine.

You must also first create a MongoDB database (https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).

## Frontend:

### Install & Start

Open a terminal in frontend folder then run the following commands

```
npm i

npm start
```

### To note

_Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files._

## Backend:

### Preparations

Transform the ".env.template" file into an ".env" file by following these guidelines:

    #### Connect to MongoDB ####

    DB_ACCESS = the access to your cluster on MongoDB

    #### Secret Key for the user email encryption (without "#") ####

    EMAIL_KEY = a secret key of your choice for the email

    #### Token key for the user password hashing (without "#") ####

    TOKEN_KEY = a secret key of your choice for the token

    #### Server port ####

    PORT = the port of the backend server (here 3000)

    #### Environment ####

    NODE_ENV = development, testing or production (here development)

### Install & Start

Open a terminal in backend folder then run the following commands

```
npm i

npm start
```

### To note

_The "images" folder will be created automatically when creating your first sauce._

_Default port : `3000` (http://localhost:3000)_

Enjoy
